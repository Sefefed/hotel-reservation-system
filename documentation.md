Requirements  Specifications
Requirements Specification Document: Hotel Room Reservation System
1. Why Requirements Specifications
Purpose
This document shall establish the objectives for a Hotel Room Reservation System. It shall define what the system is supposed to achieve and shall give the right direction to the development.
Scope
This system will manage room reservations for a hotel with a fixed number of 150 rooms. The rooms are categorized into three types: Ocean View Suites, Poolside Villas, and Garden View Rooms.
Target Audience:
This is the development document for all parties involved in the development process. The document shall set expectations about the objectives of the application.
2. Program Objectives
Primary Goal:
The basic aim of this application is to deliver an easy way to book a room, get information regarding booking, and see room availability within the hotel.
Functional Objectives:
System functionalities are required as follows:
Room Reservation:
Enable users to reserve a room by specifying their desired room type.
Check availability for the specified room type.
Collect necessary guest information for the reservation (name, gender, age, ID).
Provide a unique reservation code for the reservation.
Room Status View:
Give the user the facility to view the present availability status of all the rooms.
Booking Assistance:
Provide users with support in regards to their bookings; contact information for example.
Quit:
Allow the users to exit the application cleanly


User Experience Requirements
The system shall be easy to use, and the user shall feel easy navigating the system.			
Design and Implementation Requirements: The system shall be designed in such a way that the user is given proper prompts and feedback by the system.
It should flash the right error message the instant a user is making an error.
It shall not require the user to have prior knowledge about any hotels while using this system.
Technical Objectives:
The system will be implemented using fundamental C++ concepts, including dynamic memory allocations and pointers to store the variables of the program.
The program shall perform all its functions with sufficient speed and shall not crash.
3. Detailed Objectives
Room Reservation Objective:
The system shall allow a user to select a room type.
It should take the required information of the guest.
The system shall see if a room is available as per the type of room specified.
If available, it should allot the room and print out a success message along with the room allotted while providing the user with a reservation code.
If no rooms are available for that room type, then the system will have to reject the request.
Room Status Objective:
The system should make it easy for them to see all the rooms.
The system will display all rooms
The system will indicate whether a room is reserved or available.
Booking Assistance Objective
The system shall provide assistance to the users in terms of using the system.
Exit Application Objective
The user shall be able to exit the application through a menu option.
4. Non-Objectives (What the System Will Not Do)
The system shall not interface with a database to store reservations.
The system shall not be designed to handle over 150 rooms
System will not be implemented for advanced searching 
Users will not be authenticated through the system. 
5. Success Metrics
The ability to book the room, the status of a room, and a help functionality of the programme should meet its main purpose:
